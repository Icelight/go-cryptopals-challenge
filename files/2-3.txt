It will be a little tough to actually guess at ECB unless we have a lot of duplicate values across a few blocks as we're only working on a single piece of input. So, in order to solve this we will just pass in the following: 123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890 and trust that our ECB detection algorithm will be able to nab those!
